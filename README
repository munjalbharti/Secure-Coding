-How to get tan number?
There are 2 ways:

During registraton u have the option to select 

1. tan numbers by mail. 
2. tan numbers by SCS (Smart Card Simulator)

In case of 1st  u will receive a pdf with tan numbers. The password of pdf will also be sent.

In case of 2nd, u will be given another jar file to download. This is a java application built independently. Whenever u make a transaction  u will be prompted with a number. 

Note the number. Start the scs jar. Enter the number noted earlier. Your tan number will be given. Enter that tan number fr transaction.
